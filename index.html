<p class="story">
  Alright so, about a year ago I tripped hard with a bro of mine. The trip comeup was fun asf, good visuals and the euphoric feeling.  We smoked a good bit during comeup as to hopefully make the peak all that more intense. Not to mention we're both religious smokers per norm. That being said as we settled into the trip with some bowls outta the way, things started getting really awesome.
  About an hour in the visuals came in full force, I'm talking walls shifting and faces slowly beginning to "drip/smear". Since the visuals were so heavy we decided it might be in our best interest to watch a cartoony movie with plenty of colors as to really set the mood. We had decided mutually that Coco would be a good place to start, mind you I've seen this movie before while tripping and know for a fact that it can get crazy as fuck if you're not careful. Anyways, movie carries on and it's great, we're laughing and in awe of the magnificent colors that are exemplified by the brilliance of computer animation. After a few more minutes of being in sheer amazement by the animation before us the movie takes a turn for the worse (as all animated and most movies produced today do) this spinning the trip out of control.
  Due to the fact that the trip was spiraling, we decided it might be best to shut the movie off for a while and put on some good music to pick the mood back up and get us where we needed to be mentally. The station we decided to listen to on youtube was "Chilled Cow" to my best recollection. The steady beats offered by the live stream of music makes for an enjoyable environment no matter your setting.  We continued on this for a good while, just listening and having intermediate conversation about how each of us were feeling in regards to that events that took place in the movie and the trip thus far. Our minds were finally starting to settle down after being shaken by such emotion.
  This is where the Trip starts getting wild. We were about 2-3 hours into the trip with peak still a little ways off, not too far though. I noticed my homie (let's just call him G) kinda extending his arms and legs, grasping objects and uttering giberish. I asked G what he was doing out of honest curiosity, he responded with "just touching stuff to make sure it's really there". I was bamboozled by his response for whatever reason thus started feeling objects around me and giving myself that sense of security. Things continued for a solid 20-30 minutes it felt. Who honestly knows how long it was given LSD warps your perception of time.
  When that moment started fading where we felt the need to feel and grasp objects in our immediate surroundings as a grounding technique things took an unexpected turn. I myself identifying as a gay man somehow got on the thought process of being sexual (hilarious right?) and thus started thinking about sexual things, like  nudity, getting off and whatever else came to mind. Mind you I wasn't speaking aloud about anything in my head. Probably just the LSD right? Anyways, I kept on thinking these things and really started slipping into that euphoric feeling of excitement and anxiousness. While I'm thinking these things I look over at G and he's breathing pretty heavy and turns his head to look at me, we catch each other's gazes and for a split second we connected like I'd never connected with anyone before in my life. We immediately turned our heads and stopped the gaze.
  A few moments passed where we both swallowed very hard, hard enough I could hear his swallow and I'm sure him mine. I decided to try something, I started asking silly questions and talking all goofy inside my head like "What's up G, I wonder if you can hear this" and called G's name without uttering a word from my mouth. To my complete surprise he snapped his head back towards me and just looked at me. Within moments I could hear his voice but it' like it wasn't his voice yet it was.  So I started asking dumb questions again, like "Whats up G?, You're looking at me what's on your mind?"
  After that piece transpired between us it was just completely surreal from then on, whenever I'd ask if he could hear what I was thinking I got an immediate yes without any verbal communication. When I would start feeling aroused and notice a bulge in my shorts, I'd notice G shifting his sitting position as to hide what I could only assume was a bulge in his shorts.
  I realize this isn't really as cohesive as it should be, but can anyone relate to this report of mine?
  Any feedback in appreciated and will be duly noted! If you feel like you need to DM me then please do so if you'd like to delve deeper into what happened between myself and G. Thanks for reading.
